a. The database I created was my own pc company where I sell pc's from different suppliers and resell them to customers. I generated the fake data using a python script utilizing faker library which generates random data for me and fed the results into an excel document. From the excel document I exported it as a csv file and then imported it into MySQL Workbench. Database contains data of orders, customer info, order #, inventory, supplier info etc.

b. Exported a self contained .sql file so you would need to import it into your workbench. Attached is my .sql script file (screenshots of the results of each are in submission pdf) you would need to import to see my scripts to run them in workbench. Lastly for the python script, (I used PyCharm) but you might need to change some of the server values in the script on your pc for your local server in the script. And from there once it's connected you can run the script in terminal.

c. A, since I believe I hit all of the criteria in the guidelines

d. Challenge I faced was getting the random data for each of the tables. Since there are tables with primary and foreign keys (made sure they weren't empty), I need to make sure some of the data imported correctly and was correctly formatted into place. MySQL Workbench proved to be interesting when taking in the data and I needed to make sure that some of the data I was generating was able to be imported. Other issues faced was making sure the python scripts were working and functional. Ran into some issue with them.


* the photos for my sql scripts are in an attached pdf because I couldn't add photos to my .sql file.
